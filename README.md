Implement Detection Networks - RCNN and YOLO

1. This assignment is all about detection and implementing algorithms on your own.

2. This is a very open ended assignment, the end goal is for you to implement RCNN and YOLO model training and testing on dataset available online. You can use any dataset from the following link:

https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/top-10-open-source-datasets-for-object-detection-machine-learning-in-2021/Links to an external site.

Feel free to use any other dataset that has bounding boxes.

3. Refer to the JNB links that I shared in class to get an idea about implementing RCNN and YOLO.

4. Tasks:

Implement a bounding box detection program using both RCNN and YOLO detector (one from RCNN family and one from YOLO family).
Train your model (training must me shown in your JNB) 
Load your trained model and in real-time, show bounding box detection using the webcam of your camera.
You can share the real time detection in a video and upload that with your assignment.
Submit your code and video in a zip file to canvas.
